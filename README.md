# Whiteout Survival Helper üéÆ‚ú®

## Overview

The Whiteout Survival Helper is a Go-based automation tool designed to interact with the "Whiteout Survival" game. This application monitors the game for specific UI elements (like the handshake icon) and performs automated clicks based on the defined targets.

- **Monitor Application**: Continuously checks if the "Whiteout Survival" application is running.
- **Template Matching**: Uses OpenCV to locate predefined images (e.g., handshake icon) on the game window.
- **Automatic Clicks**: Simulates mouse clicks on the identified UI elements.
- **Logging**: Captures logs of actions taken and errors encountered.
- **Customizable Targets**: Easily add more target templates for additional interactions.
- **Randomized Delays**: Implements random delays to mimic human behavior.
